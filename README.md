####**Project Focus**
Advanced OO (Object Oriented) Design & Programming.

####**Project Brief**
The construction of a Two-player Battleships game running on a two-dimensional grid (10x10) on which ships can be placed.

####**Project Description**
Following placement of ships on his or her board, **Player 1** then turns to announce target squares on the opposing board belonging to **Player 2** where missiles will be shot. These missiles either land in water or strike opposing ships belonging to **Player 2**; in-turn allowing **Player 1** to build-up an idea of the **Player 2** fleet.

The application requires the creation of a simplified management system for each players ships, sequential placement, registration of missiles onto grid references and finally, the win or lose result with objects created each time a game is initialized.

####**Project Objectives**
* CRC model creation: **classes employed** w/repo (GitHub)
* Project Domain Model: **design & Implementation** (Classes/Interactions)
* Project Presentation: open discussion of **chosen objects & dependent interactions** within the final game version to the Makers Academy cohort.

####**Domain Model**
>> Final version awaiting implementation
